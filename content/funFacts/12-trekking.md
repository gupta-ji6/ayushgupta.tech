title: Trekking

I enjoy **trekking**, and when I lived in Bengaluru, I frequently went on night treks (check out my [instagram](https://ayushgupta.tech/ig) highlights to see them). I have already completed hikes to Raghupur Fort and Triund, to mention a couple. My bucket list still includes places like the Valley of Flowers, Har ki Dun, the Great Lakes of Kashmir, Hemkund Sahib, Kedarnath, and others. Soon!
