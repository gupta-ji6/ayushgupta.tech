My [first ever tech blog](https://ayushgupta.tech/blog/grid-vs-flex) I wrote [on Medium](https://medium.com/p/783005dd2412) back in 2018 has 177K+ views, 97% of which came from google searches. For the keyword "css grid, flexbox," it used to appear as a featured snippet on Google. The same article was also [recommened](https://css-tricks.com/quick-whats-the-difference-between-flexbox-and-grid/#:~:text=other%20layout%20methods-,Ayush%20Gupta,-%3A%20Beginner%E2%80%99s%20Guide) on the OG CSS Tricks website. Receiving such a response as a newbie in the tech was astounding for me!
